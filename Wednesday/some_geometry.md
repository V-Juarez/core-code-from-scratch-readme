# Some geometry

## Description

Design an algorithm to calculate the volumen of a pyramid, a cube and a sphere..

### Algorithm the Volumen Pyramid

1. LIsta data of Pyramid
2. Choose data -> area "B", height "h"
3. Apply form volume of pyramid
	1. Volumen Pyramid | V = 1/3 * Bh
4. Enjoy solving the problem
5. Volume of pyramid obtained.
### Algorithm the Volumen Cube
1. LIsta data of Cube
2. Choose data -> The three sides are equal a * a * a
3. Apply form volume of Cube
	1. Volumen Cube | Cube = a * a * a
4. Enjoy solving the problem
5. Volume of Cube obtained.

### Algorithm the Volumen Sphere
1. LIsta data of Sphere
2. Choose data -> radius, r = 4/3 πr³.
3. Apply form volume of Sphere
	1. Volumen Sphere | Sphere = (4/3)  * πr³.
4. Enjoy solving the problem
5. Volume of Sphere obtained.
